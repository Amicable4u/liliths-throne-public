## TODO (this fork)

* More cheat menu options (add exp, change fetishes, modify present characters, transform, rest)
* Pet play (allow to ride slaves with saddles, bit gags)
* Dialogue for playing with toys / bondage items (Buttplug lick clean, hit with crop)
* * Buttplug unequip:
* * InventoryDialogue.java: new Response("Unequip", "Unequip the "
* "Get Bathed" option (if slave is in party)
* Pain play (impact, electro, sharps, slave job punching-bag)
* extended cum play (display in mouth, cum sharing)
* Watersports
* Hypno
* Allow NPCs to use "AskAction" during sex
* Allow sub to "role play as dom" (can perform any action, but must always answer yes to requests, and must ask before performing non self-penetrative actions)
* Slave job femdom
* Allow dom giving directions to other pairs during multi participant scenes (eat her pussy etc.)
* Slowly build attraction / obedience with multiple victories over an encountered NPC, resulting in mutually satisfying sex (and perhaps more influence if chastity devices are used)
* "Imposing" option: skip combat by intimidating the opposition, or showing off particular skills
* find ways to increase physique (enchantments)
* find ways to change an NPC's gender preferences (modify over time if eager during sex? player exception after enough affection?)
* Original body & kinks (see what the player has transformed their slaves into)
* Flesh out "Talk about background" (SlaveDialogue.java)
* Flesh out the bounty system (bar in Slaver's alley)
* Flesh out companions system
* Abstraction for referring to the other partner (pet names, dominant, submissive, gentle or rough terms)
* different copy when doms use "Offer" SexActions
* work out how to add references to the play / other named NPCs in NPC descriptions
