  * change time
  * get item (spawn in inventory with ItemType.getAllItems())
* Pet play (allow to ride slaves with saddles, bit gags)

* Watersports
* Hypno
* Allow NPCs to use "AskAction" during sex

* Slave job femdom
* Allow dom giving directions to other pairs during multi participant scenes (eat her pussy etc.)
* Slowly build attraction / obedience with multiple victories over an encountered NPC, resulting in mutually satisfying sex (and perhaps more influence if chastity devices are used)
* "Imposing" option: skip combat by intimidating the opposition, or showing off particular skills
* find ways to increase physique (enchantments)
* find ways to change an NPC's gender preferences (modify over time if eager during sex? player exception after enough affection?)
* Original body & kinks (see what the player has transformed their slaves into)
* Flesh out "Talk about background" (SlaveDialogue.java)
* Flesh out the bounty system (bar in Slaver's alley)
* Flesh out companions system
* Abstraction for referring to the other partner (pet names, dominant, submissive, gentle or rough terms)
* different copy when doms use "Offer" SexActions
* work out how to add references to the play / other named NPCs in NPC descriptions
* SlaveForSale NPCs sometimes end up wearing two collars at once (the player has two keys) due to equipClothing override
